# 8085 Micropressor-in-C-

A Microprocessor Implementation by C++ coding which was given to us in 3rd year by our C++ Professor and among the topics available, I chose this one.

Edit: GitHub doesn't allow '+' operator in their naming scheme and so I have uploaded 2 files to stick true to the code. Both Code Will Run perfectly in codeblocks

This code replicates how you can physically use a microprocessor. Use the Code '99' to exit from the program and all other real life codes will work. All the real life codes of 8085 Microprocessor can be found and executed through the code.
