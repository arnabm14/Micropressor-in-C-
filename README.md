# Micropressor-in-C-
A Microprocessor Implementation by C++ coding which was given to us in 3rd year by our C++ Professor and among the topics available, I chose this one.

Edit: GitHub doesn't allow '+' operator in their naming scheme and so I have uploaded 2 files to stick true to the code. Both Code Will Run perfectly in codeblocks
